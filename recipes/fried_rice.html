    <img src="../images/SpamFriedRice.jpg" alt="picture of spam fried rice">
    <h2>So with a full pot of perfectly cooked white rice, I couldn&apos;t help but make some fried rice. I&apos;ve made pancetta fried rice and quinoa fried rice so I went a different route using Spam. I know that some people have HUGE aversions to canned meat but Spam was a major staple in our household growing up and it was such a delight when my mom would break open a can of Spam. Plus, with a drizzle of Sriracha, this Spam fried rice quickly became a childhood favorite!</h2>
